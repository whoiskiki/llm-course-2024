    Generate text samples using a main model and select the best sample based on a reward model's guidance.

    This function generates multiple text samples from a main model, evaluates each sample using a reward model,
    and returns the sample with the highest reward score. The process is guided by the reward model to select
    the most desirable output.

    Parameters:
    main_model: The language model used to generate text samples.
    main_tokenizer: The tokenizer for main_model
    reward_model: The model used to compute reward scores for the generated samples.
    reward_tokenizer: The tokenizer for reward_model
    N (int, optional): The number of text samples to generate. Default is 16.
    device (str, optional): The device on which the computation should be performed. Default is 'cpu'.

    Returns:
    str: The generated text sample with the highest reward score.
